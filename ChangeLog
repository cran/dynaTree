1.2-1 (2 Sept 2011)
----

Fully documented sensitivity analysis code and relevance
calculation code, IECI and other online learning code not
yet documented
	

1.2 (25 June 2011)
---

Fully documented the online learning additions and
added demos and examples


1.1 (13 May 2011)
---

added copy.dynaTree function using copy_cloud_R and
rejuvinate.dynaTree using rejuvinate_R; these are
still undocumented

updated JASA reference and changed to Booth addresses

discovered/fixed bug in classification marginal 
likelihood

initial implementation of sensitivity analysis code

initial implementation of online retiring, and added
alcX and entropyX calculations for choosing retires,
and drift for historical retirement

multiple growing rectangle proposing types

specify Xref locations in ALC calculation, and analytic
version by specifying a rectangle through Xref

propagate posterior probabilities now in log space

implemented residual resampling for resample step

streamlined prediction by accumulating (summing) each
particle's predictive rather than storing in big 
matrices which are then averaged

implemented predictive probability calculations for 
Expected Likelihood comparisons


1.0-2 (10 Aug 2010)
-----

simplified the prediction routines under the LM with 
centering

also now allows icept = FALSE with LM


1.0-1 (16 July 2010)
-----

changed to LU version of the hyper-rectangle for proposing 
grow tree operations

added splitmin and basemax and added proj argument to 
plot.dynaTree for 1-d projections


1.0 (02 June 2010)
---

Initial version
