fleshed out genereics to remove check warnings


1.2-14 (19 Oct 2022)
------

dealt with clang-15 warnings


1.2-13 (10 Jun 2022)
------

replaced akima with interp and now require suggests


1.2-12 (01 Apr 2022)
------

fixed clang and BLAS issues from Brian


1.2-11 (29 March 2022)
------

updated links and dealt with DOUBLE_ constants as per
Ripley


1.2-10 (13 March 2017)
------

changed fmin to fmin2 for Brian and Solaris; updated to VT
affiliation


1.2-9 (06 June 2016)
-----

little upgrades to get it back on CRAN, and change web page,
and added Chris to authors


1.2-8 (15 Dec 2014)
-----

(via linking to tgp) fixed three abs to fabs in matrix.c

removed namespace std in cloud.h


1.2-7 (16 Sept 2013)
-----

added variance of mean and DoF outputs to predict_R for
regression models

correction of title and description in relevance doc file

implementing qEntropy and other active learning stats
for learning about contours

fixed bug in tree proposals when tree prior a=0

added coef.dynaTree function to extract coefficients from
linear leaf models

added average number of leaves to treestats


1.2-6 (21 April 2012)
-----

dealt with NULL issues and updated to mystdout and 
mystderr


1.2-5 (06 Jan 2012)
-----

added NAMESPACE file


1.2-4 (18 Dec 2011)
-----

now depends on R 2.14.0


1.2-3 (16 Dec 2011)
-----

added NDEBUG to Makevars

Fixed bug when retiring with forgetting in the linear model
(lambda < 1).  Needed to re-calc bb and other sufficient stats
that don't need to be done in the lambda=1 case.

added treestats.dynaTree function and changed varprop* 
functions to be methods of type dynaTree

implemented sameleaf function to calculation average number
of other points in the same leaf as each row of X

extra check of bb <= 0 in calculate_linear defaulting to 
constant model, but there are still cases where this doesn't
work quite right

added Tree::Collapse in as a crude initial attempt to fix
trees with leaf nodes that become improper after a retirement
with forgetting


1.2-2 (27 Sept 2011)
----

Fixed bug in retire.dynaTree that was causing y-labels to be 
off by 1 for classification; this was leading to an assertion 
failure in sens.dynaTree

fixed typos in documentation


1.2-1 (2 Sept 2011)
----

Fully documented sensitivity analysis code and relevance
calculation code, IECI and other online learning code not
yet documented
	

1.2 (25 June 2011)
---

Fully documented the online learning additions and
added demos and examples


1.1 (13 May 2011)
---

added copy.dynaTree function using copy_cloud_R and
rejuvinate.dynaTree using rejuvinate_R; these are
still undocumented

updated JASA reference and changed to Booth addresses

discovered/fixed bug in classification marginal 
likelihood

initial implementation of sensitivity analysis code

initial implementation of online retiring, and added
alcX and entropyX calculations for choosing retires,
and drift for historical retirement

multiple growing rectangle proposing types

specify Xref locations in ALC calculation, and analytic
version by specifying a rectangle through Xref

propagate posterior probabilities now in log space

implemented residual resampling for resample step

streamlined prediction by accumulating (summing) each
particle's predictive rather than storing in big 
matrices which are then averaged

implemented predictive probability calculations for 
Expected Likelihood comparisons


1.0-2 (10 Aug 2010)
-----

simplified the prediction routines under the LM with 
centering

also now allows icept = FALSE with LM


1.0-1 (16 July 2010)
-----

changed to LU version of the hyper-rectangle for proposing 
grow tree operations

added splitmin and basemax and added proj argument to 
plot.dynaTree for 1-d projections


1.0 (02 June 2010)
---

Initial version
